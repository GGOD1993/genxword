# genxword

## A crossword generator

## Description

Genxword is a crossword generator written in Python. There are now two versions, [genxword-gtk](https://github.com/riverrun/genxword/wiki/genxword-gtk), which has a graphical user interface, and genxword, which runs from the command line. 
Both versions create a crossword from a list of words and clues. You can save the crossword, with clues, as a pdf file, 
or you can save the empty grid and key in png and/or svg format, together with the word bank and clues in a text file.

## Features
* The crossword can be saved, with clues, as a pdf file, or the empty grid and key 
can be saved in png and/or svg format, together with the word bank and clues in a text file.
* The crossword can be recalculated multiple times - with the option to increase the grid size at each stage.
* A dictionary file can be used as the word list. A certain amount of words (default 50) will be 
randomly selected from the file and used to make the crossword.
* When editing the word list, there is an option to sort it, from the shortest 
to the longest word, and remove non-alphabetic characters.
* Multiple languages, including right-to-left languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic, 
are now supported by both the Python2.7 and Python3 versions.
