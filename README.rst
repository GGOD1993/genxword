Description
===========

Genxword is a crossword generator written in Python. There are now two versions, `genxword-gtk <https://github.com/riverrun/genxword/wiki/genxword-gtk>`_, which has a graphical user interface, and genxword, which runs from the command line. 
Both versions create a crossword from a list of words and clues. You can save the crossword, with clues, as a pdf file, 
or you can save the empty grid and key in png and/or svg format, together with the word bank and clues in a text file.
